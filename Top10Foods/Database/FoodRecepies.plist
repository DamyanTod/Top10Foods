				<string>Ingredients: ©2 cartons double cream, 1 large (284ml) plus 1 small (142ml) ©100ml full-fat milk ©1 vanilla pod ©5 large egg yolks ©50g golden caster sugar, plus extra for the topping Recipe: ©Preheat the oven to fan 160C/conventional 180C/gas 4. Sit four 175ml ramekins in a deep roasting tin at least 7.5cm deep (or a large deep cake tin), one that will enable a baking tray to sit well above the ramekins when laid across the top of the tin. Pour the two cartons of cream into a medium pan with the milk. Lay the vanilla pod on a board and slice lengthways through the middle with a sharp knife to split it in two. Use the tip of the knife to scrape out all the tiny seeds into the cream mixture. Drop the vanilla pod in as well, and set aside. ©Put the egg yolks and sugar in a mixing bowl and whisk for 1 minute with an electric hand whisk until paler in colour and a bit fluffy. Put the pan with the cream on a medium heat and bring almost to the boil. As soon as you see bubbles appear round the edge, take the pan off the heat. ©Pour the hot cream into the beaten egg yolks, stirring with a wire whisk as you do so, and scraping out the seeds from the pan. Set a fine sieve over a large wide jug or bowl and pour the hot ixture through to strain it, encouraging any stray vanilla seeds through at the end. Using a big spoon, scoop off all the pale foam that is sitting on the top of the liquid (this will be several spoonfuls) and discard. Give the mixture a stir. ©Pour in enough hot water (from the tap is fine) into the roasting tin to come about 1.5cm up the sides of the ramekins. Pour the hot cream into the ramekins so you fill them up right to the top – it’s easier to spoon in the last little bit. Put them in the oven and lay a baking sheet over the top of the tin so it sits well above the ramekins and completely covers them, but not the whole tin, leaving a small gap at one side to allow air to circulate. Bake for 30-35 minutes until the mixture is softly set. To check, gently sway the roasting tin and if the crème brûlées are ready, they will wobble a bit like a jelly in the middle. Don’t let them get too firm. ©Lift the ramekins out of the roasting tin with oven gloves and set them on a wire rack to cool for a couple of minutes only, then put in the fridge to cool completely. This can be done overnight without affecting the texture. ©When ready to serve, wipe round the top edge of the dishes, sprinkle 1½ tsp of caster sugar over each ramekin and spread it out with the back of a spoon to completely cover (Anne Willan’s tip for an even layer). Spray with a little water using a fine spray (the sort you buy in a craft shop) to just dampen the sugar – then use a blow torch to caramelise it. Hold the flame just above the sugar and keep moving it round and round until caramelised. Serve when the brûlée is firm, or within an hour or two.</string>

				<string>Ingredients: For the dishes: ©25g unsalted butter, for greasing ©finely grated chocolate For the creme patisserie : ©2 tbsp plain flour ©2 tsp caster sugar ©½ tsp cornflour ©1 medium egg yolk ©1 medium whole egg ©4 tbsp milk ©1 tbsp double cream ©25g good-quality dark chocolate preferably 70% cocoa solids, broken in pieces ©1 tbsp cocoa powder For the egg whites: ©6 medium egg whites ©85g caster sugar ©single cream or ice cream, to serve For the ganache: ©4 tbsp double cream ©50g good-quality dark chocolate preferably 70% cocoa solids, broken into pieces ©1 tbsp cocoa Recipe: ©Take four 200ml soufflé dishes and brush them completely with softened butter. Chill the dishes for 5 mins, then, as an insurance policy so the soufflé doesn’t stick to the dish, apply a second coat as before. Tip a little grated chocolate into each dish, roll the dish around tilting it as you do so it is evenly lined all round. ©For the crème patisserie, mix the flour, sugar and cornflour. Put egg yolk and whole egg into a bowl, stir, then beat in half of the flour mixture to give a smooth paste. Tip in the rest of the flour mixture and mix well. ©Pour the milk and cream into a pan and bring just to the boil. Remove from the heat. Add the chocolate and beat until it is melted and smooth with no lumps. ©Gradually stir hot chocolate mix into paste. Return to pan. Cook, stirring, over a medium-low heat for 5 mins to a smooth, thick paste. Remove from the heat. Leave until cold, beating occasionally with a wire whisk ©Make the ganache: slowly warm the cream in a pan. Just before it boils, take off the heat and add chocolate. Beat constantly to a velvety texture, gradually sprinkling in the cocoa as it dissolves. Allow to cool. ©Heat oven to 190C/fan 170C/gas 5. Whisk the egg whites to soft peaks with an electric whisk. Sprinkle in the sugar as you are mixing. Keep whisking to give stiff, firm peaks to give volume to the soufflés. ©Mix crème patisserie and ganache in a large bowl. Stir in 2 tbsp of egg white. Carefully fold in a third of the rest, cutting through the mixture. Fold in another third (take care not to lose the volume); fold in the rest. ©Spoon the mixture into the dishes to fill them by three-quarters, then gently press a spoon in to make sure it fills all the gaps. Fill the dishes to the top with the mixture, then bang each dish on to the surface so the mixture fills the sides. ©Take a palette knife and pull it across the top of each dish so the mixture is completely flat. Take a little time to wipe any splashes off the outside of each dish, or they will burn on while cooking. ©So mixture won’t stick to the top of the mould, and to give a straight finish, go around the top edge of the mixture with your finger. Sprinkle a little grated chocolate in the centre, then bake the soufflés for 15-17 mins. ©The soufflés should have risen by about two thirds of their original height and jiggle when moved, but be set on top. To serve, make a small dip with a spoon in the centre of each, then pour in single cream or add a spoonful of ice cream.</string>

				<string>Ingredients: ©1/3 cup kosher salt, plus more for seasoning ©2 tablespoons light brown sugar ©3 pounds pork back ribs or baby back ribs, cut into 3 sections ©6 pounds sauerkraut (in plastic bags), drained ©1/4 cup duck or goose fat or peanut oil ©1 large onion, coarsely chopped ©4 large garlic cloves, coarsely chopped ©20 juniper berries ©3 large bay leaves ©1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds ©1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper ©3 cups chicken stock ©1 1/2 cups Riesling or Pinot Gris ©2 pounds Polish kielbasa, skinned and cut into 2-inch pieces ©10 skinless hot dogs ©One 2-pound piece of boneless boiled ham (3 to 4 inches wide), sliced 1/4 inch thick ©2 pounds medium potatoes (about 10), peeled ©Assorted mustards, for serving Recipe: ©In a large, sturdy, resealable plastic bag, combine the 1/3 cup of kosher salt with the sugar. Add the pork ribs; shake well to thoroughly coat the ribs with the seasonings. Seal the bag and refrigerate the ribs overnight or for up to 24 hours. ©The next day, preheat the oven to 300°. Rinse the sauerkraut in cold water and squeeze dry. Set a large roasting pan over 2 burners on high heat and melt the duck fat. Add the onion and garlic and cook over moderately low heat, stirring, until softened, about 7 minutes. Stir in the sauerkraut, juniper berries, bay leaves, caraway seeds, black pepper, stock and wine and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. ©Meanwhile, rinse the pork ribs under cold water and pat dry. Nestle the pork ribs in the sauerkraut and bring back to a boil over moderately high heat. Cover tightly with foil and bake for 1 1/2 hours. ©Remove the pork ribs from the sauerkraut. Cut down in between the ribs. Return the ribs to the sauerkraut and nestle in the kielbasa, hot dogs and ham. Cover and bake until the meats are hot, about 25 minutes. Discard the bay leaves. ©Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, cover the potatoes with cold water, add salt and bring to a boil over high heat; cook the potatoes until tender when pierced. Drain the potatoes and cover to keep warm. ©To serve, mound the hot sauerkraut in the center of very hot dinner plates and partially tuck in the pork ribs and the kielbasa. Arrange the hot dogs and ham around the sauerkraut. Alternatively, pile the sauerkraut on a large heated platter and garnish with the meats. Serve the choucroute with the boiled potatoes and assorted mustards.</string>

				<string>Ingredients: ©3 tsp goose fat ©600g shin beef, cut into large chunks ©100g smoked streaky bacon, sliced ©350g shallots or pearl onions, peeled ©250g chestnut mushrooms (about 20) ©2 garlic clove, sliced ©1 bouquet garni (See know-how below) ©1 tbsp tomato purée ©750ml bottle red wine, Burgundy is good For the celeriac mash ©600g (about 1) celeriac ©2 tbsp olive oil ©rosemary and thyme sprigs ©2 bay leaves ©4 cardamom pod Recipe: ©Heat a large casserole pan and add 1 tbsp goose fat. Season the beef and fry until golden brown, about 3-5 mins, then turn over and fry the other side until the meat is browned all over, adding more fat if necessary. Do this in 2-3 batches, transferring the meat to a colander set over a bowl when browned. ©In the same pan, fry the bacon, shallots or pearl onions, mushrooms , garlic and bouquet garni until lightly browned. Mix in the tomato purée and cook for a few mins, stirring into the mixture. This enriches the bourguignon and makes a great base for the stew. Then return the beef and any drained juices to the pan and stir through. ©Pour over the wine and about 100ml water so the meat bobs up from the liquid, but isn’t completely covered. Bring to the boil and use a spoon to scrape the caramelised cooking juices from the bottom of the pan – this will give the stew more flavour. ©Heat oven to 150C/fan 130C/gas 2. Make a cartouche: tear off a square of foil slightly larger than the casserole, arrange it in the pan so it covers the top of the stew and trim away any excess foil. Then cook for 3 hrs. If the sauce looks watery, remove the beef and veg with a slotted spoon, and set aside. Cook the sauce over a high heat for a few mins until the sauce has thickened a little, then return the beef and vegetables to the pan. ©To make the celeriac mash, peel the celeriac and cut into cubes. Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan. Tip in the celeriac and fry for 5 mins until it turns golden. Season well with salt and pepper. Stir in the rosemary, thyme bay and cardamom pods, then pour over 200ml water, enough to nearly cover the celeriac. Turn the heat to low, partially cover the pan and leave to simmer for 25-30 mins. ©After 25-30 mins, the celeriac should be soft and most of the water will have evaporated. Drain away any remaining water, then remove the herb sprigs, bay and cardamom pods. Lightly crush with a potato masher, then finish with a glug of olive oil and season to taste. Spoon the beef bourguignon into serving bowls and place a large spoonful of the celeriac mash on top. Garnish with one of the bay leaves, if you like.</string>

				<string>Ingredients: ©1 x 1.3kg organic chicken, jointed into 8 (see steps and method) ©5 tbsp plain flour ©75ml olive oil ©250g smoked streaky bacon, cut in pieces ©1 onion chopped ©2 carrots, peeled and roughly chopped ©2 leeks, trimmed, washed and roughly chopped ©250g shallot, peeled, but left whole ©2 sprigs fresh rosemary. ©2 sprigs fresh thyme ©2 bay leaves ©100ml cognac ©1 bottle red wine, preferably from Burgundy ©100ml chicken stock (preferably homemade (see Know-how below) ©250g fresh cep mushrooms or large chestnuts mushrooms, trimmed and thickly sliced Recipe: ©Joint the chicken (for pictures of jointing, click on step by step link above or read the instructions below. Alternatively, ask the butcher to do it for you). ©JOINTING THE CHICKEN: Pull out the wing joints and cut off the wing tip. Using a small knife, cut around the skin and flesh on the lower wing joint through to the bone, then scrape back the flesh. Using a heavier large knife, smash through the bone halfway along and detach. Repeat on the other side. ©Detach the scaly leg bone at the drumstick with a hefty thump of the large knife. Slash through skin where the thigh joins the body and pull leg firmly from socket to dislocate the thigh bone. Press down and pull to expose the 'oyster' muscle underneath the bird. Slice the thigh away from the back of the body. ©Lay the whole leg joint out on the board, find the mid-point socket joint and simply cut straight through it for neat thigh and leg joints. Repeat on the other side. ©Cut through the skin and flesh halfway along to the drumstick and scrape back the flesh, then smash through the bone. ©Using poultry scissors or heavy kitchen scissors, cut away the back half of the breast carcass, to leave a 'crown' of chicken breast and wing joint. Cut through the top of the crown to divide in half for two chicken breasts. ©Lay each breast joint on the board, then cut in half again at right angles so you have one portion with a wing joint and one without. You should now have eight neat, joints of chicken. ©Put the flour into a bowl with some salt and pepper, then toss in the chicken, shaking off the excess. Place the chicken on a plate and season again. ©Heat 4 tbsp of oil in a large shallow pan and brown the chicken joints. (Do this in batches if your pan is not large enough, adding extra oil if necessary.) Tip the bacon into the pan along with the chicken, stirring until lightly browned and crisp. Using tongs, remove the chicken to a plate. ©Add all the vegetables and herbs to the bacon with a splash more oil, if necessary, then cook for about 5 mins, stirring once or twice. Pour in the Cognac and bubble up, scraping the pan to deglaze, for 2-3 mins. Then pour in all the wine and bring to the boil. ©Tip in the chicken joints; press into the pan so they are immersed in liquid and cook, uncovered, for 10 mins, until the wine has reduced by half. Pour in the stock, return to a simmer, season and cook, uncovered, for 1 hr until the liquid has reduced by half and the chicken is tender. Set aside for 10 mins before serving. ©Heat another 4 tbsp oil in a large frying pan and, when hot, fry the mushrooms for about 8 mins, seasoning well and stirring frequently until nicely browned. Remove and drain on kitchen paper. Serve the chicken in bowls with vegetables and sauce spooned over, and top with the mushrooms.</string>

				<string>Ingredients: ©600g medium-sized King Edward potatoes or Maris Piper potatoes ©sunflower oil for frying ©2 x 200g/8oz beef steaks ©2 handfuls mixed leaves ©dressing of your choice, to serve For the butter: ©50g butter, softened ©small handful parsley leaves, finely chopped ©1 small garlic clove, minced (optional) ©small squeeze lemon juice Recipe: ©First make the butter: mash all the ingredients together with lots of cracked black pepper. Pat the butter flat between cling film (it’ll chill quicker when thinner) and put in the fridge or freezer to harden. ©Cut the potatoes into neat chips, rinse under hot water, then dry on a tea towel. Place the chips in a deep saucepan (they should only come up a third of the way) and just cover with cold oil. Place the pan on a medium heat, bring the oil to a simmer and give the chips a stir with a wooden spoon. Increase the heat so the oil bubbles really quickly and fry the chips, stirring occasionally so they don’t stick, until crisp and golden – the whole process will take 15-20 mins. When they are done, scoop out with a slotted spoon onto a plate lined with kitchen paper and set aside. ©Meanwhile, heat the griddle pan until smoking hot. Season the steaks with salt and pepper and rub with a little oil – how you cook your steak will depend on the cut you have chosen and its thickness. For a steak that’s 2cm thick, cook it for 2 mins on each side for rare, adding 1 min more for every increasing degree of doneness. Just before lifting the steaks off the griddle, place half the butter on top of each. Serve the steaks with the chips, some mixed leaves and a tangy dressing.</string>

				<string>Ingredients: For the pastry: ©175g plain flour ©100g cold butter, cut into pieces ©1 egg yolk For the filling: ©200g pack lardon, unsmoked or smoked ©50g Gruyère ©200ml carton crème fraîche ©200ml double cream ©3 eggs, well beaten ©pinch ground nutmeg Recipe: ©For the pastry, put the flour, butter, egg yolk and 4 tsp cold water into a food processor. Using the pulse button, process until the mix binds. Tip the pastry onto a lightly floured surface, gather into a smooth ball, then roll out as thinly as you can. Line a 23 x 2.5cm loose-bottomed, fluted flan tin, easing the pastry into the base. Trim the pastry edges with scissors (save any trimmings) so it sits slightly above the tin (if it shrinks, it shouldn’t now go below the level of the tin). Press the pastry into the flutes, lightly prick the base with a fork, then chill for 10 mins. Put a baking sheet in the oven and heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. ©Line pastry case with foil, shiny side down, fill with dry beans and bake on the hot sheet for 15 mins. Remove foil and beans and bake for 4-5 mins more until the pastry is pale golden. If you notice any small holes or cracks, patch up with pastry trimmings. You can make up to this point a day ahead. ©While the pastry cooks, prepare the filling. Heat a small frying pan, tip in the lardons and fry for a couple of mins. Drain off any liquid that comes out, then continue cooking until the lardons just start to colour, but aren’t crisp. Remove and drain on paper towels. Cut three quarters of the cheese into small dice and finely grate the rest. Scatter the diced cheese and fried lardons over the bottom of the pastry case. ©Using a spoon, beat the crème fraîche to slacken it then slowly beat in the double cream. Mix in the beaten eggs. Season (you shouldn’t need much salt) and add nutmeg. Pour three-quarters of the filling into the pastry case. ©Half-pull the oven shelf out and put the flan tin on the baking sheet. Quickly pour the rest of the filling into the pastry case – you get it right to the top this way. Scatter the grated cheese over the top, then carefully push the shelf back into the oven. Lower the oven to 190C/fan 170C/gas 5. Bake for about 25 mins, or until golden and softly set (the centre should not feel too firm). Let the quiche settle for 4-5 mins, then remove from the tin. Serve freshly baked, although it’s also good cold.</string>

Add the garlic, cayenne and salt and process until the bread and garlic are coarsely chopped. With the machine on, drizzle in the olive oil and process until the rouille is smooth. Transfer to a bowl and refrigerate. ©In a very large, deep skillet, heat the 3 tablespoons of olive oil. Add the leeks, onion, fennel and chopped garlic and cook over moderate heat until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook until they begin to break down, about 5 minutes. Add the bay leaves, saffron and pastis and bring to a boil. Add the fish stock and bring to a simmer. Cook over low heat until the vegetables are very tender, about 20 minutes. Discard the bay leaves. ©In a food processor, pulse the vegetables and broth to a coarse puree. Strain through a fine sieve set over the skillet. ©Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the lobster and cook until it turns bright red, about 4 minutes. Drain and rinse the lobster under cold water until cool enough to handle. Remove the tail, claw and knuckle meat and cut into 1-inch pieces. ©Preheat the broiler. Arrange the baguette slices on a baking sheet and broil them 6 inches from the heat for about 1 minute per side, until the slices are golden brown around the edges. Rub each slice with the remaining whole garlic clove and drizzle lightly with olive oil. ©Add the potatoes and cayenne pepper to the broth and bring to a simmer. Cook over moderately high heat until the potatoes are just tender, about 10 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Add the clams, cover and cook over moderate heat until they just begin to open, about 3 minutes. Add the monkfish, cover and simmer for 2 minutes. Add the lobster, snapper and halibut, cover and simmer until the clams are open and all the fish is cooked through, about 4 minutes. ©Set a baguette toast in each of 8 shallow bowls. Ladle the fish and broth over the toasts and top each serving with 1 tablespoon of the rouille. Sprinkle with fennel fronds and serve immediately.</string>

Place a large resealable plastic bag into a bowl and then pour the brine into the bag. Submerge the pork in the brine, seal the bag and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and no longer than 6 hours. ©Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Remove the pork from the brine, pat it dry and sprinkle it liberally with salt and pepper. ©Heat the oil in a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat and brown the pork loin on all sides, about 8 minutes total.

Transfer to a board and let rest for 20 minutes. ©Meanwhile, make the pan sauce. Pour out the fat from the skillet and reserve, and then heat the skillet over medium-high heat. Pour in the stock, scraping off any browned bits on the bottom using a whisk. Cook until the stock has reduced by half, 2 to 4 minutes, and then turn the heat down to low and whisk in the butter one piece at a time. Whisk in the mustard and season with salt and pepper. Transfer the sauce to a small saucepan and cover to keep warm. ©For the brussels sprouts: Thinly slice the Brussels sprouts using a Japanese or French mandolin or a sharp knife. Wipe out the skillet used for the pan sauce and heat 3 tablespoons of the reserved pork fat over medium-high heat. Add the shallots and cook until slightly softened and lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes, and then add the sprouts and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Cook until the sprouts are tender yet crisp and starting to brown slightly, 3 to 5 minutes. ©To serve, thinly slice the pork and place on a platter. Spoon the pan sauce on top and serve with the Brussels sprouts, German dumplings, and remaining pan sauce on the side.</string>

Just do me a favor please and do not add chicken. All the rest is fine with me. ©It should be cooked fast and at a high heat so that the tomatoes retain their summer sweetness, yet long enough to lose the watery quality that signals a bad sauce.</string>

You can do this in a small food processor, but I think it is more fun to do it by hand. ©Place the kemirinuts and chili in the mortar and pestle, grind into a paste and transfer to the bowl. ©Dissolve the creamed coconut in the boiling water and add to the bowl. ©Add all the other ingredients for the satay into the bowl, except the meat. Mix well. ©Slice the pork into strips or cubes, add to the bowl and mix well with the marinade. Cover and leave to marinate for 2 hours. The marinade is very fragrant, so make sure you cover the bowl very, very well before you place the bowl in the fridge, otherwise your fridge and everything in it will smell like satay. ©Make the satay sauce. Place everything together in a small pan and warm on low heat until the peanut butter has dissolved and the sauce is slightly thickened. Stir regularly to prevent sticking/burning. ©Cook the satay. Skewer the meat if you want to. ©Heat a non-stick frying pan on medium heat. Place the pieces of meat or the skewers in the pan together with the marinade, cooking on medium heat until slightly brown and cooked through.

Stir in the currants, raisins and apple. Cover the bowl, and leave the batter in a warm place to rise until double in size. This will take about 1 hour. ©Heat the oil in a deep-fryer, or heavy deep pan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Use 2 metal spoons to shape scoops of dough into balls, and drop them carefully into the hot oil. ©Fry the balls until golden brown, about 8 minutes. The doughnuts should be soft and not greasy. If the oil is not hot enough, the outside will be tough and the insides greasy. Drain finished doughnuts on paper towels and dust with confectioners' sugar. Serve them piled on a dish with more confectioners' sugar dusted over them. Eat them hot if possible.</string>

				<string>Ingredients: ©500g self-raising flour ©2 large eggs ©800ml milk ©1 tsp vanilla extract ©a pinch of salt ©olive oil for brushing the pan Recipe: ©Sift flour in a large bowl. Combine milk, eggs and vanilla extract in a bowl and mix lightly. Add the wet mixture to the flour and beat well for 3-5 minutes till the batter is light and fluffy. Cover and stand batter for an hour. ©Pour batter into a squeeze bottle [like the ones you get in the supermarket for sauce]. Place Poffertje pan on the cooktop at low-medium heat. Brush pan with a liberal dose of olive oil. When the oil is hot, squeeze the batter into each hole, filling it just below the rim. When bubbles start appearing in the batter, flip over each pancake gently in their holes with a butter knife. Cook this side for 2-3 minutes and slide the pancakes onto a plate. Serving suggestions: ©Serve hot with strawberries, fresh cream, nuts and chocolate sauce. ©These pancakes can also be served simply with a drizzling of coarse sugar, topped with freshly squeezed lemon juice. Notes: ©The quantity mentioned here is enough to make 90-95 pancakes, which would come to 5-6 serves. ©A good quality cast-iron dutch poffertje pan is vital to make these crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. ©Gemcake pans work well for this recipe too. ©While cooking the heat has to be adjusted constantly, if you feel the pan starts smoking or the pancakes are browning very fast, reduce the heat a bit. ©The quantity of milk mentioned here has worked well for me, but if the eggs and flour are of different sizes and brand respectively, you might need to add more milk. The batter has to be of thick, pouring consistency.</string>

				<string>Ingredients: ©125 ml olive oil ©4 large waxy potatoes, peeled and finely sliced ©1 onion, sliced ©4 eggs, lightly beaten ©salt and pepper to taste ©1 teaspoon chopped flat leaf parsley (optional) Recipe: ©Heat some of the olive in a 20 cm skillet. Add some of the potato slices so that you cover the skillet with a layer of the potatoes. Next, add some of the onions and season with salt. Alternate the potatoes and onions, adding olive oil as you go. So basically it is potatoes, then onions, the salt, then a drizzle of olive oil before you add on the next layers. Potatoes, onions, salt, olive oil etc. Cook this over medium heat, turning the mixture once in a while until the potatoes are tender but not browned. This took me around 15 minutes but cooking times can vary. ©When the potatoes are done, they should be tender enough to be pricked with a fork without any resistance, drain them in a colander, reserving the olive oil to use for cooking the rest of the omelette. If there is more oil than what you need, don’t throw it away – this can be used for cooking other things as well so save it for future use. ©Cool the potato mixture slightly, around 10 minutes and place this in a bowl with the beaten eggs. Allow the mixture to rest for around 10 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper. ©Clean the skillet and heat 2 tablespoons of the olive in the large skillet until very hot and add the potato mixture, rapidly spreading it out in the skillet. Lower the heat to medium and shake the pan often to prevent sticking. Use a thin spatula to run along the sides of the skillet so that some of the egg can run under and cook more evenly. This takes around 6 to 8 minutes. ©When the mixture begins to brown and just before you flip the tortilla, loosen it by sliding a thin spatula between the egg and the side of the skillet walls. Place a plate slightly larger than the skillet over the skillet. Remove the skillet from the heat and flip the omelet on to the plate so you can brown the other side. ©Add about 2 tablespoons more to the skillet, and then slide the flipped omelet back on to the skillet so that the cooked side is facing the top. Cook the omelet for another 5 minutes over medium heat. ©Flip the omelet 2 or 3 more times (this helps to give a good shape), cooking briefly on each side.</string>

Stir in the garlic, and before it begins to color, add the tomatoes. Add the sugar, salt to taste, pimentón (or paprika), and saffron, stir well, and cook until the tomatoes are reduced to a jammy sauce and the oil is sizzling. Add the squid and cook, stirring, for a minute or so. Add the rice and stir well until all the grains are coated. (You can prepare the dish to this point up to an hour in advance.) ©Bring the stock and wine to a boil in a saucepan. Pour over the rice, bring to a boil, and add salt to taste (even if the broth tastes a bit salty, it will not be salty when it is absorbed by the rice). Stir well and spread the rice out evenly in the pan (do not stir again). Cook the rice over low heat for 18 to 20 minutes, moving the pan around and rotating it so that the rice cooks evenly. Lay the shrimp on top after 10 minutes and turn them when they have become pink on the first side. Add a little more hot stock toward the end if the rice seems too dry and you hear crackly frying noises before it is done. When the rice is done, turn off the heat and cover the pan with a large piece of foil. ©Steam the mussels with a finger of water in a pan with a tight-fitting lid. As soon as they open, they are cooked. Throw away any that have not opened. ©Arrange the mussels on top of the paella.</string>

Taste and add seasoning. It will probably need a good pinch of pepper, but may not require any salt as the bacon is fairly salty. ©Keep warm while you fry the eggs or you prepare the egg yolks in their shells. ©Serve on to hot plates, top with an egg, a side serving of pickled beetroot and garnish with fresh herbs.</string>

				<string>Ingredients: For the sponge cake: ©4 eggs ©1 cup (225g) sugar ©1/2 cup (62g) flour ©1/2 cup (80g) potato starch flour ©1 teaspoon baking powder ©breadcrumbs For the vanilla custard: ©1 cup (240ml) heavy cream ©4 egg yolks ©3 tablespoons potato starch flour or 2 tablespoons corn starch ©2 tablespoons sugar ©4 teaspoons vanilla sugar or 2 teaspoons vanilla extract For the assembly: ©2 cups (480ml) heavy cream, whipped ©10 ounces (300g) marzipan ©green and yellow food coloring ©powdered sugar for dusting ©purchased marzipan rose and leaves for garnish or extra marzipan and red food coloring Recipe: Make the cake ©Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Thoroughly butter a 9″ x 2″ (2 liter) round baking pan. Toss in enough breadcrumbs to cover the bottom and sides of the pan and shake them around to ensure all surfaces are covered (the same as you would typically do with flour when baking a cake, you are just using breadcrumbs instead). ©Place the eggs and sugar in a mixing bowl and beat on high speed until light colored and fluffy. ©Blend the flour and baking powder together and carefully fold them into the egg and sugar mixture until thoroughly blended. Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and bake in the lower portion of the oven for about 40 minutes or until golden and a toothpick comes out clean. Let the cake cool slightly in the pan before turning it out onto a rack to cool completely. Make the vanilla custard ©Place the cream, egg yolks, potato flour, and sugar in a small saucepan and whisk together (do not use a steel whisk as it can turn the custard grayish). Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the custard thickens. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla. If cooking the custard with potato starch flour you need to use the custard shortly after you make it. If using corn starch the custard can be prepared a day ahead and stored in the refrigerator. Prepare the marzipan ©Knead the marzipan with your hands to soften it up and add the green and yellow food coloring sparingly until you have achieved a bright, spring green. Flatten the marzipan into a disk. Place it between two pieces of parchment paper or on a smooth surface dusted with powdered sugar and roll it into a thin, even circle ideally about 1/32″ (just under 2mm) thick but do the best you can to thin it out. Keep in mind the circle has to be large enough to cover the entire cake. You can dust the marzipan and work surface with powdered sugar if need be to prevent sticking. Assemble the prinsesstårta (It’s helpful to refer to the pictures above) ©Once the sponge cake has cooled completely, slice it into three layers keeping the top layer a bit thinner than the others. Start to assemble the prinsesstårta by spreading a thin layer of jam onto the bottom layer of the sponge cake. Add a generous layer of vanilla custard by either piping or spreading it over the jam. Add the next layer of sponge cake and another generous layer of vanilla custard. Whip the 2 cups (480ml) of heavy cream until stiff and pile a generous, fluffy mound onto the last custard layer. Add the final layer of sponge cake and gently form it into a dome shape over the cream being careful not to squish too much cream out of the sides. Spread a thin layer of cream over the top to even out and seal the surface. Gently lay the thin marzipan sheet over the top of the cake and use your hands to help define the shape. Trim the excess marzipan from the bottom of the cake by using a pizza or pastry wheel or a very sharp knife. Dust the top with sifted powdered sugar (you can use a tea strainer) and garnish with a pink marzipan rose with leaves. ©The cake needs to be refrigerated until serving time and any leftovers need to be refrigerated as well. Ideally the cake should be eaten the day it is made.</string>

				<string>Ingredients: ©4 cod fish fillets or 4 haddock fillets ©6 ounces plain flour ©1 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda ©1 (8 fluid ounce) bottle british beer, Small ©1⁄2 lemon, juice of ©salt &amp; pepper ©extra flour ©3 lbs potatoes, peeled &amp; chipped ©good quality cooking fat or oil Recipe: ©Heat fat up in a chip pan or automatic deep fat fryer - mine has a chip setting which is 190°C. ©Peel the potatoes and cut into chunky sized chips. Rinse and dry thoroughly. ©Fry chips for about 3 minutes until soft but NOT coloured. Drain and shake well and set to one side. ©Put some flour onto a plate. Dredge the fish fillets in the flour thoroughly - this is VERY important, it stops the batter sliding off when fried! Leave the fish fillets in the flour whilst you make the batter. ©Some people say you should make the batter at least one hour before - I have found little difference - so make it before if it is convenient or now! ©Put flour, bicarbonate of soda, salt and pepper into a large roomy bowl. Add the beer gradually, stop when you have a thick coating type of batter. Drink any beer that is left! Whisk thoroughly until it is smooth and there are no lumps.Add the lemon juice OR a splash of malt vinegar if desired. Mix thoroughly again. ©Have your plates, newspaper or whatever ready for eating! ©Adjust deep fat fryer to fish frying temperature of 160°C. ©Take one fillet of fish at a time and holding it by the tail or thin end (!) swirl it around the batter until well coated - plunge into hot fat immediately. As soon as it has crisped up and set, add your other fillets one at a time, taking out the first ones as they cook - about 6 to 10 minutes depending on the thickness. Place onto a tray and keep warm in the oven. ©Turn up the heat setting to 190°C again and cook your chips until golden and crisp. ©Serve on plates or newspaper with salt &amp; vinegar! ©All you need now is a pint of warm beer and Coronation Street on the TV to set the scene! ©This batter is great for small fish goujons, chicken goujons and also tempura vegetables too.</string>

				<string>Ingredients: ©300g raspberries, plus a few extra to serve ©225g blackberries, plus a few extra to serve ©100g redcurrants, plus a few extra to serve ©400g strawberries, hulled and quartered ©140g golden caster sugar, plus a bit extra (optional) ©400g brioche loaf ©clotted cream, to serve (optional) Recipe: ©Wash the fruit and place it all (except the strawberries) in a large pan with the caster sugar and 3 tbsp water. Gently heat for 3 mins until the juice from the fruit starts to seep out. Add the strawberries and cook for 2 mins more. Drain the juice from the fruit through a sieve set over a large bowl. Taste the juice and add a little more sugar if necessary. ©Line a 1.2-litre pudding basin with a double layer of cling film, leaving an overlap around the top. Remove the crusts from the brioche and slice the loaf into 1cm-thick slices along the length of the loaf. Cut 1 slice in half widthways and trim the corners to fit into the base of the bowl – you may need to use both squares, trimmed to fit. ©Trim the slices to the correct length to line the sides of the bowl. To assemble the pudding, dip the slices of brioche into the fruit juice, then use them to line the basin. Start with the bottom pieces, then lay soaked rectangles of brioche along the sides of the bowl. If you have any gaps left at the end, patch these up with any remaining brioche, but make sure you save some for the base. ©Tip the fruit into the lined basin. Finish the pudding with a layer of brioche to make a base, then pour over any remaining liquid. Wrap the overhanging cling film over the top. ©Place a small plate, which will fit snugly on top of the basin, over the cling film and weigh down with 2 x 400g cans of tomatoes or beans. Leave the pudding weighed down in the fridge for at least a couple of hours, or overnight if possible. ©To serve, unwrap the cling film and place a serving plate over the pudding. Flip it over, remove the basin and carefully peel away the cling film. Serve in slices with clotted cream, if you like.</string>

Season the chicken to taste and fry for 5-8 mins until golden brown, turning occasionally. You may need to do this in two batches, depending on the size of your pan. Lift the chicken onto a plate and tip the bacon into the pan. Fry for 5 mins until crisp. Add the onion, mushroom and thyme, then fry on a high heat for another 3 mins until the onion start to colour. ©Tip the flour into the pan and cook, stirring, for 1 min. With the pan off the heat, gradually stir or whisk in the stock, followed by the milk, then add the chicken back to the pan. Bring to the boil, then simmer for 30 mins. Spoon the filling into a large pie or baking dish (approx 20 x 30cm) with a lip and leave to cool. ©Heat oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7. On a floured surface, roll the pastry to the thickness of two £1 coins. Cut a long strip as wide as the rim of the pie dish and, using a little of the egg, fix to the edge of the pie dish. Brush with egg, then lift the rest of the pastry over the pie, using the rolling pin to help. Gently press the edges with your fingers and trim with a sharp knife. Brush lightly with egg to glaze, then bake for 30 mins or until the pastry is risen and dark golden brown.</string>

				<string>Ingredients: ©a good beef fillet (preferably Aberdeen Angus) of around 1kg/2lb 4oz ©3 tbsp olive oil ©250g/ 9oz chestnut mushroom ,include some wild ones if you like ©50g/ 2oz butter ©1 large sprig fresh thyme ©100ml/ 3½ fl oz dry white wine ©12 slices prosciutto ©500g/1lb 2oz pack puff pastry, thawed if frozen ©a little flour for dusting ©2 egg yolks beaten with 1 tsp water Recipe: ©Heat oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7. Sit the 1kg beef fillet on a roasting tray, brush with 1 tbsp olive oil and season with pepper, then roast for 15 mins for medium-rare or 20 mins for medium. When the beef is cooked to your liking, remove from the oven to cool, then chill in the fridge for about 20 mins. ©While the beef is cooling, chop 250g chestnuts (and wild, if you like) mushrooms as finely as possible so they have the texture of coarse breadcrumbs. You can use a food processor to do this, but make sure you pulse-chop the mushrooms so they don’t become a slurry. ©Heat 2 tbsp of the olive oil and 50g butter in a large pan and fry the mushrooms on a medium heat, with 1 large sprig fresh thyme, for about 10 mins stirring often, until you have a softened mixture. Season the mushroom mixture, pour over 100ml dry white wine and cook for about 10 mins until all the wine has been absorbed. The mixture should hold its shape when stirred. Remove the mushroom duxelle from the pan to cool and discard the thyme. ©Overlap two pieces of cling film over a large chopping board. Lay 12 slices prosciutto on the cling film, slightly overlapping, in a double row. Spread half the duxelles over the prosciutto, then sit the fillet on it and spread the remaining duxelles over. Use the cling film’s edges to draw the prosciutto around the fillet, then roll it into a sausage shape, twisting the ends of cling film to tighten it as you go. Chill the fillet while you roll out the pastry. ©Dust your work surface with a little flour. Roll out a third of the 500g pack of puff pastry to a 18 x 30cm strip and place on a non-stick baking sheet. Roll out the remainder of the 500g pack of puff pastry to about 28 x 36cm. Unravel the fillet from the cling film and sit it in the centre of the smaller strip of pastry. Beat the 2 egg yolks with 1 tsp water and brush the pastry’s edges, and the top and sides of the wrapped fillet. Using a rolling pin, carefully lift and drape the larger piece of pastry over the fillet, pressing well into the sides. Trim the joins to about a 4cm rim. Seal the rim with the edge of a fork or spoon handle. Glaze all over with more egg yolk and, using the back of a knife, mark the beef Wellington with long diagonal lines taking care not to cut into the pastry. Chill for at least 30 mins and up to 24 hrs. ©Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. Brush the Wellington with a little more egg yolk and cook until golden and crisp – 20-25 mins for medium-rare beef, 30 mins for medium. Allow to stand for 10 mins before serving in thick slices.</string>

				<string>Ingredients: ©400g skinless white fish fillet ©400g skinless smoked haddock fillet ©600ml full-fat milk ©1 small onion, quartered ©4 cloves ©2 bay leaves ©4 eggs ©small bunch parsley, leaves only, chopped ©100g butter ©50g plain flour ©pinch freshly grated nutmeg ©1kg floury potato, peeled and cut into even-sized chunks ©50g cheddar, grated Recipe: ©Poach the fish. Put the fish in the frying pan and pour over 500ml of the milk. Stud each onion quarter with a clove, then add to the milk, with the bay leaves. Bring the milk just to the boil – you will see a few small bubbles. Reduce the heat and simmer for 8 mins. Lift the fish onto a plate and strain the milk into a jug to cool. Flake the fish into large pieces in the baking dish. ©Hard-boil the eggs . Bring a small pan of water to a gentle boil, then carefully lower the eggs in with a slotted spoon. Bring the water back to a gentle boil, with just a couple of bubbles rising to the surface. Set the timer for 8 mins, cook, then drain and cool in a bowl of cold water. Peel, slice into quarters and arrange on top of the fish, then scatter over the chopped parsley ©Make the sauce. Melt half the butter in a pan, stir in the flour and cook for 1 min over moderate heat. Take off the heat, pour in a little of the cold poaching milk, then stir until blended. Continue to add the milk gradually, mixing well until you have a smooth sauce. Return to the heat, bring to the boil and cook for 5 mins, stirring continually, until it coats the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat, season with salt, pepper and nutmeg, then pour over the fish. ©Assemble and bake. Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. Boil the potatoes for 20 mins. Drain, season and mash with the remaining butter and milk. Use to top the pie, starting at the edge of the dish and working your way in – push the mash right to the edges to seal. Fluff the top with a fork, sprinkle with cheese, then bake for 30 mins. Make up to a day ahead, chill, then bake for 40 mins. TIP: ©Seafood: Add 200g raw peeled king prawns to the baking dish along with the poached fish. Salmon &amp; dill: Replace the smoked haddock with 400g skinless salmon fillets, and use dill instead of the parsley. Fish &amp; vegetable: Add 100g each frozen peas and sweetcorn to the baking dish before pouring over the sauce</string>

Remove from the heat and drain off the water – this helps to get rid of some of the saltiness. Recover with 2 litres cold water and bring to the boil again. Put everything but the frozen peas into the pan and bring to the boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook for 1½-2½ hrs, topping up the water as and when you need to, to a similar level it started at. As the ham cooks and softens, you can halve it if you want, so it is all submerged under the liquid. When the ham is tender enough to pull into shreds, it is ready. ©Lift out the ham, peel off and discard the skin. While it is still hot (wear a clean pair of rubber gloves), shred the meat. Remove bay from the soup and stir in the frozen peas. Simmer for 1 min, then blend until smooth. Add a splash of water if too thick, and return to the pan to heat through if it has cooled, or if you are making ahead. ©When you are ready to serve, mix the hot soup with most of the ham – gently reheat if made ahead. Serve in bowls with the remaining ham scattered on top, and eat with crusty bread and butter.</string>

Turn off heat. Melt butter in a heavy pan large enough to hold the pasta after it is cooked. (It will take at least a 14-inch saute pan or a large casserole that can take direct heat.) When foam from butter recedes, remove from heat, add flour, and mix well. Return to medium-low heat, and, stirring occasionally, simmer for 2 to 3 minutes to cook, but not brown, the flour. Gradually stir in hot milk. Raise heat to medium-high and continue stirring until mixture is smooth and thick (about 5 minutes). Add Parmesan and Romano cheeses. Whisk until smooth. Add Tabasco and white pepper and blend. ©Cook rigatoni in boiling salted water about 4 minutes. (It will be underdone, but will finish cooking later.) Thoroughly drain rigatoni and fold it into the cheese mixture. ©If cooking immediately, preheat oven to 375 degrees. ©Layer one-half the rigatoni mixture into a 9x13 pan. Top with one-half of the Cheddar and mozzarella. Repeat layers. Top with chili powder, sprinkled evenly over top. ©If not baking immediately, cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate or freeze. When ready to bake, drizzle the 3/4 cup milk over the dish. Bake for approximately one hour. If frozen, add at least 20 minutes to baking time. The dish should be rusty brown on top. Should it appear to be browning too fast, cover with foil for part of cooking time. Be sure to check for doneness in the very centre of the dish.</string>
